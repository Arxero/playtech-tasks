# Playtech Tasks

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.7.

## Start

Run `npm i` then `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Brakets Validator

Create a small script to validate the parentheses in a program code. The purpose is to validate all opening and closing brackets and their balanced order, and there may be different types of brackets () {} [] ".

Create a very simple UI with a text box, where you can enter the validation code and a button for its validation. In case of success or error, the corresponding message must be displayed.

## Weekly Forecast

Weather forecast with Angular and TypeScript. Make a weekly forecast with images for each day that contain an icon showing the time, the name of the day of the week, and minimum / maximum temperature values.

Icons can be clicked and more data can be displayed below them, such as precipitation probability in percentages, sunrise time and wind speed. This functionality should be like a radio button, ie if I press Monday and then Tuesday, the details of Monday will have to be hidden. The page must be able to change the units of Celsius and Fahrenheit, with Celsius by default. The data for this forecast can be from a local json.
